## 🌐 Instant Web Deployment Options

The project is pre-configured for automated deployment across multiple cloud providers and GitHub Actions.

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Automatic via GitHub Action)
The repository includes a ready-to-run GitHub Action workflow: [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](./.github/workflows/deploy.yml).

1. Push this repository to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/herita.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
   - Under **Build and deployment** > **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**.
3. The workflow will automatically test and deploy your site to:
   👉 `https://<your-username>.github.io/herita/`
   *(Includes intelligent client-side fallbacks so all features, maps, quizzes, and passport stats operate seamlessly even on static hosts!)*

---

### Option 2: Vercel (Recommended for Full-Stack Serverless)
Pre-configured with [`vercel.json`](./vercel.json) and [`api/index.js`](./api/index.js).

1. Install Vercel CLI (or connect via github.com/vercel):
   ```powershell
   npx vercel
   ```
2. Follow the 2 prompts. Your full-stack Express API and client will be deployed live with an instant SSL domain:
   👉 `https://herita.vercel.app`

---

### Option 3: Render (Free Web Service with Full Node.js Runtime)
Pre-configured with [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml).

1. Push to GitHub.
2. Go to [render.com](https://render.com) > **New** > **Blueprint**.
3. Select your repository. Render automatically reads `render.yaml` and launches your service:
   👉 `https://herita.onrender.com`

---

### Option 4: Instant Public URL from Your Current Machine (5 Seconds)
If you want to share a live public link with judges or team members right now without pushing to GitHub:
```powershell
npx localtunnel --port 3000
```
This gives you an instant public HTTPS URL like `https://funny-bhopal-herita.loca.lt` forwarding directly to your running server!

---

## 💻 Running Locally

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Mishthi\.gemini\antigravity\scratch\herita
node server.js
```
Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.
